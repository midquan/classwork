Programing Assignment 3
Tests ListADT operations

Sparse.java 
Used to parse inputs and push the outputs onto a file. 

Matrix.java
Matrix ADT with an Entry Inner class using an array of Linked Lists. Features many functions to 
help with adding and subtracting matrices.

List.java
Previous assignment's List ADT changed to accept Objects instead of ints. 

MatrixTest.java
Tests Matrix's functions to help to check to see if its working or not

ListTest.java
Tests List's functions to help to check to see if its working or not.

Additional Note:
My program did not function as I wanted it to. I was repeatedly getting a null pointer exception.
Whenever I called changeEntry. So many of the tests and inputs do not work. However much of my 
code should work as intended if the bug is fixed.
