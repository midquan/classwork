## Pacman

A modified version of the Pacman educational project from the Berkley AI Lab:

### FAQ

**Q:** What version of Python does this project support?  
**A:** Python >= 3.5.
The original version of this project was written for Python 2, but it has since been updated.

**Q:** Why are there no packages? Seems disorganized...  
**A:** You are right, this project is not designed with modern Python package-oriented design principles.
This project is meant for students who may be seeing Python for the first time,
and therefore has been simplified.

**Q:** What's with these `_student` files?  
**A:** The `_student` files are the files that students will edit to complete assignments.
When an assignment is graded, any other pacman files (without the `_student` suffix) that a student submits will
be overwritten.
This makes it clear to the student what files they are allowed to change.
It is not pretty (and not how non-educational projects should be designed), but it is easy for students and graders.
