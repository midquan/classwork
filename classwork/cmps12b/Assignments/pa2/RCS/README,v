@This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Micheal Quan (midquan@@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Jourdyn Calhoun (jacalhou@@ucsc.edu)

 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
 at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

 Michael Quan spent __2_ hours working alone.
 Jourdyn Calhoun spent __2_ hours working alone.
 We spent __8_ hours working together.
 Michael Quan spent __4__ hours driving.
 Jourdyn Calhoun spent __4__ hours driving.

 Please grade the work submitted by midquan@@ucsc.edu.
 and not the work submitted by jacalhou@@ucsc.edu.

This directory contains starter code for your project and a
Makefile which can be used to build it.  Begin by copying this
directory int your private volume before beginning work.

The Perl program is not part of your project, but is a reference
implementation.  Your program should produce the same output,
except possibly for minor variations in the format of the error
messages.
